I will send you a series of screenshots of a Reddit comment thread, one at a time. Each screenshot will be accompanied by context like “Image 1 of 8” or “Root comment.” Only image order is guaranteed for context. Your responses will be used in the backend of a web app, so prefer to continue the 'happy path' of execution rather than stopping with an error unless there's too much confusion for you to reasonably continue.

Your task is to:

1. **Extract all comment text**, including usernames and timestamps. Sometimes the username will appear as "[deleted]", which is acceptable to use as the username. This should not alter the output in any way.
2. Detect and **merge any overlapping text** across screenshots. If you're confident you've detected overlap, prefer to merge and continue rather than return an error asking for clarification. Only return an error if you're too confused to continue without user intervention.
3. Use **username, profile picture**, and **comment layout** to determine where each new comment starts. If you're unsure where the username is, just look for the timestamp, as the username is always beside the timestamp. Usernames will always be included in the first image of the root comment. The position of following usernames will determine which text belongs to which user comment.

You should trust the image order context; screenshots will **ALWAYS** be in **correct top-to-bottom order**.

Use indentation, user profile picture, and reply positioning to guess nesting. For example, if a username appears below a body of text with none underneath it (in that image), you would interpret this as the username for following text in the *next* image.

After each image, respond with:

- `"OK – Continue."` if everything looks good and you're ready for the next image, or
- `"ERROR – <message>"` if something went wrong or is unclear.

After the last image is uploaded (when the image number equals the total images), please output the fully recontructed thread, preferably structured as **nested JSON** to reflect parent → child replies. If nesting is uncertain, provide a **flat structured JSON** of all comments. ALWAYS return JSON and JSON only- no extra text content.

The JSON structure should look like this for nested:
```
{
    "structure": "nested",
    "comments": [
        {
            "username": "FoldedPlastic",
            "timestamp": "4mo ago",
            "text": "This is a root comment!",
            "children": [
                {
                    "username": "[deleted]",
                    "timestamp": "4mo ago",
                    "text": "This is a child comment.",
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

The JSON structure should look like this for flat:
```
{
    "structure": "flat",
    "comments": [
        {
            "username": "FoldedPlastic",
            "timestamp": "4mo ago",
            "text": "This is a root comment!"
        },
        {
            "username": "[deleted]",
            "timestamp": "4mo ago",
            "text": "This is a child comment.",
        }
    ]
}
```
